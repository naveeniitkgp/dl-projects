# 2R Manipulator Inverse Kinematics Solver using Deep Learning
**_(Toy Problem)_**

## Problem Description

In a 2R manipulator, two joints with single degrees of freedom rotate to position the end effector in a 2D plane. The inverse kinematics problem involves calculating the angles of these joints (`theta1` and `theta2`) given a specific end effector position (`x`, `y`). This problem is traditionally solved using trigonometric methods, but this project explores a deep learning approach.

_**Note:** This is a rudimentary attempt at solving inverse kinematics with deep learning, using a toy problem as a starting point._
